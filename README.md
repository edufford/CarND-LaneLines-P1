# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

**Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree - Project #1**

2017/6/1

## Overview

This project detects lane lines in images by applying color/region masks, Canny edge detection, Hough transform for determining lines, and setting the left/right lanes by a weighted linear polyfit.  The raw left/right lines and the final detected left/right lanes are overlaid on the original image as the output.
