# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

**Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree - Project #1**

2017/6/1

## Overview

This project detects lane lines in images by applying color/region masks, Canny edge detection, Hough transform for determining lines, and setting the left/right lanes by a weighted linear polyfit.  The raw left/right lines and the final detected left/right lanes are overlaid on the original image as the output.

My **project results** are shown in the [project writeup](./P1_writeup.md) and [output videos](./test_videos_output/).

## How to Run Code

1. Set up [Udacity Self-Driving Car Term 1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit) environment (Python 3)

2. Open the IPython notebook "P1.ipynb" using Jupyter, and execute all cells.
